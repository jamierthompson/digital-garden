/**
 * `cardSwatches(brandColor)` — engine Consumer C (§3.2, §6).
 *
 * The `/work` index cards want "a few colours per card" derived from a project's
 * `brandColor`, but WITHOUT a project scope: no island, no `<style>` tag, no class —
 * just a small bag of inline CSS custom properties (`--c-*`) to spread onto a card
 * element's `style={…}`. This is a CONSUMER of the OKLCH engine, not part of it, so it
 * lives in `src/lib/` rather than `src/lib/oklch/` (§3.2).
 *
 * It runs on the SAME defensive parse/validate path as everything else: it delegates to
 * the high-level `buildTokenSet`, which parses defensively, gamut-maps, contrast-solves,
 * and — on bad/missing/hostile input — returns the safe fallback palette with
 * `meta.isFallback = true`. So `cardSwatches` is TOTAL: it NEVER throws and always
 * returns a valid swatch object [D9].
 *
 * Values are BAKED literals, composed the same way `oklch/css.ts` composes them: each
 * stop is `light-dark(<light oklch() literal>, <dark oklch() literal>)` so a card reads
 * correctly in both schemes with zero runtime color math in the browser [D3, D5].
 *
 * WHICH STOPS, AND WHY — kept deliberately to "a few", the minimum a self-themed card
 * needs to stand apart on the shared `/work` grid:
 *   • `--c-surface` — the card's own tinted background fill (brand-tinted near-neutral).
 *   • `--c-border`  — its edge / divider against the page (contrast-solved hairline).
 *   • `--c-text`    — body/label text that clears AA on that surface.
 *   • `--c-accent`  — the brand pop (chip, rule, hover) — the card's identity at a glance.
 * These map 1:1 onto engine tokens, so the colours are exactly the contrast-solved ones
 * the full project scope would use — just a curated subset, inline, with no scope.
